Approach taken:

- use of IIFE with Revealing module pattern (could just use IIFE with no namespace)
- use of Vanilla JavaScript without JQuery or any JS MV Frameworks;
- use of ES6 let/const when appropriate (reading up on ES6 currently)
- wanted a simple, script with no dependencies

Enhancements:

- use a Gulp script to kick off a build and build app from resources
- adopt a TDD approach and write unit tests first before write code
- use of SASS
- use more ES6; e.g. use import/export features and drop namespace
- add field validation with error messages;
- add more configuration for user: e.g. query for searches on coffee houses etc. make limit and version configurable for api
- add in validation for no results
- add in more date from JSON Venue items
